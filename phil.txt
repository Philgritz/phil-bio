-Before Apprenti I was doing title work in the oil and gas industry in Southeastern Ohio
-I was looking for a career change.  After learning more about programming, it sounded like an excellent fit
and a more stable career, as it would always be in demand.  Apprenti seemed like an extremely good way to break into this field
-Ideally I would stay with a company long term (Paycor), as I know I want to remain in the Cincinnati area.  I would prefer
to remain with a company to build lasting relationships, and progress within the company as a developer.
